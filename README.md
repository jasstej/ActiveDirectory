# 🧠 Active Directory Lab – JasstejTrace.exe

> *"In the kingdom of networks, AD is the crown. This is my forge, my battleground, my blueprint."*

Welcome to the **Active Directory Lab** by `JasstejTrace.exe`.  
This repository is a curated, no-shortcuts guide to understanding, deploying, hardening, and ethically attacking an AD environment.

Whether you're a blue team sentinel or a red team shadow, this lab is crafted to give you **real-world, ops-grade experience** with Microsoft’s identity backbone.

## 🏗️ Lab Blueprint

- **Windows Server Core** + **Client VMs**
- **Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)**
- **DNS, DHCP, GPO, OU Hierarchy**
- **Tiered Administration & RBAC**
- **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)**
- **Sysmon + Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)**
- **Offensive Simulation: mimikatz, BloodHound, Rubeus**
- **Defensive Tuning: Sigma Rules, GPO Logging, LAPS**

## 🔥 Why This Lab?

Because most guides are either:
- Too shallow 💧  
- Too bloated 📦  
- Or skip the parts where things **actually break** 🧨  

This one?
- Gives you every GPO, script, and config used
- Breaks it down by **attack surface** and **defensive control**
- Includes **attacker and defender POVs**
- Structured like a **real enterprise scenario**, not textbook fluff
